I was playing with this design during covid lockdown for a fun bedroom mood lighting/mirror as a way to keep myself busy.

The main idea was to sort of infinity-mirror a full 32x32 LED panel and see how it reacts. The effect was pretty striking. After the initial mirror effect was built, the project ballooned into a whole thing with physical buttons to modify the pattern, and also IFTTT automations to control my other apartment lights through Hue Bridge. The resulting bloat kinda killed it. 

Playing with ESP 32 dev board and automations were great fun, also getting to use the additional processing power of the ESP32 to smooth out the LED panel patterns. But the big question is whether it was worth hand-drilling 1024 holes in an acrylic mirror...
