My 3d printer needed a personality. So I built this system to emulate a robot artist personality on an instagram account that can automatically post content and respond to instagram user comments.

The project result is shown at [@autopot.ter](https://www.instagram.com/autopot.ter/). Definitely visit the instagram account for a better understanding of how this thing works. My text description below is lacking in examples..

{/* https://dash.elfsight.com/apps/instagram-feed */}
import InstagramFeed from '../../components/InstagramFeed.astro';

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <InstagramFeed widgetId="6bd7dd25-1e56-4a93-82f7-ab88bea62769" />
</div>


## Goal
The basic goal of the system is to present the 3d printer as a sentient robot artist. 

The system has two primary components:
- Content generation: auto-generate instagram posts
- Instagram account control: Posting videos, and autoreplying to comments


The system automatically generates content from a catalog of existing images and videos of my art, then it manages instagram posts and comments from its personality.


## Availble Resources:
The system has access to the following resources to use in content generation:
- Instagram account insights (new followers, post history, statistics)
- Media Library: 
    - A collection of timelapse videos captured by the 3d printer
    - Images and videos of Completed Works
    - Build videos of the 3d printer being constructed
- A description of the media library and how to use it
- A Personally/History document of the 3d printer's "personality"
- Post Request

## Basic flow:
1. Request list of media files from the media library
2. Request most recent instagram insights
3. Upload all resources to a GPT model
4. Request a "social media post" from the gpt model based on the resources, and the personality document
5. Parse the response, and upload the response to the json2video api
6. Download the video from the json2video api
7. Upload the video and it's caption to instagram
