A custom MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) cabinet I built in my living room with a ruler, jig saw, and a drill driver. It features shu sugi ban wood finishing, an inset monitor to enable LED backlighting, and a Raspberry Pi controller. 

Living in NYC has meant that I have to do lots of my projects in my living room. This project happened mostly in my living room, except for the wood burning part which I did in the back alley and definitely got a random person yelling at me from their apartment window about it. 

TODO: The original motivation for this build was the game "Nothing Good Can Come of This", but this (closed source) game wouldn't load on Raspberry Pi for whatever reason so I need to replace the Pi with a Windows mini PC :(
