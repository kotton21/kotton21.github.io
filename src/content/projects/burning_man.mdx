## Super efficient swamp coolers

My camp mates were constantly asking to take a nap in my tent :)

## Bycycle Build

My first-burn-anxiety about being cool enough demanded that I build a really cool looking bike. I learned that was the wrong motivation, but it was really validating everytime someone would start chasing me thought the desert to ask how I built it!

## WIP: Printing Playa Dust

As may found out in 2022, playa dust mud is really close to clay.. ðŸ˜‚ 

This was my first (off-playa) test of printing playa dust with my paste 3d printer.  It's much 'stickier' than conventional clay and so it doesn't print very cleanly, but a bigger nozzle and some woter content fine-tuning should help. I'll bring my printer to playa next year (2026) to print directly on-playa!"
