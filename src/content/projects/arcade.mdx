Pretty simply described, this is a custom MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) cabinet I built. It features shu sugi ban wood finishing, a outset monitor to enable LED backlighting, and a Raspberry Pi controller. 

TODO: The original motivation for this build was the game "Nothing Good Can Come of This", but this (closed source) game wouldn't load on Raspberry Pi for whatever reason so I need to replace the Pi with a Windows mini PC :(
