Around the time I was getting bored of hand-thrown pottery, I discovered ceramic 3D printing.

I wanted to create shapes that were unique to 3d printing. Good ceramic printing doesn't hide it's technology from the end viewer. Instead of trying to smooth out the layer lines left by the printing process, I wanted to lean into the tech as part of the artistic process. 

The most popular modeling software for designing clay printable shapes were limiting and boring, consisting of a few slider bars for to control a radially symmetric shape's outer curve and a few settings for surface texture. So I wrote my own software. 

Again, was this a good idea? I don't know but I clearly have an insatiable urge to do things myself if the existing systems are slightly below my specs.
