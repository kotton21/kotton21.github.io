What are the 3 things I really want people to know about me?
1. I'm really thoughtfully artistic
2. I'm highly versatile (can do lots of different things)
3. I'm personable and easy to get along with!
Put a picture of me somewhere here!!!

In a world of brutally functional technology, nothing hits the spot like the clever symmetry of artistic creativity with thoughtful science in the creation of a thing.  This portfolio leans more heavily towards the latter--building tech into my art--but I've included a few examples of my projects that went public during my time at [Snapchat](/projects/snapchat) in the [Projects](./projects) Page.


<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '2rem', alignItems: 'center', margin: '2rem 0', padding: '0 5rem'}}>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', minWidth: '250px' }}>
    <p>
      My work with 3D Printed Pottery is my best example of artistic synergy with technology.  I spent months perfecting the clay preparation, extruder design, and machine configurations to create the clean, smooth layer lines that so strongly define this work.  
    </p>
    <p>
      My art doesn't need to hide its creation process.  Rather, I make the process inseparable from the work itself by leaving the layer lines permanent and proudly displayed.  In my 3D printed pottery, the layer lines, and the timelapse videos of the printing process are both an important part of the completed work.

Before 3D Printed Ceramics, [Laser Pottery](/projects/laser_pottery) was my first attempt at this concept.  In fact, most of my ceramics projects (beyond [handbuilding](/projects/20yearsofpottery)), seek to infuse the tech, and the tech production process, into the art.

{/* ## Purpose: 
Really this should be some kind of illustrated cover letter. It should quickly illustrate the breadth of my skills and experience.
- Technical skills: 
- working with hands
- hardware / software hacking
- i can learn/build whatever needs to be built
- versatility and adaptable to new projects, requirements
- working with a wide range of tools and technologies */
