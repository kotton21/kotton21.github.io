Autoposter: An AI personality assited instagram poster

My clay 3d printer needed a personality. So I built this system to automate an instagram account for the robot.

The basic function of the system is to present the 3d printer as a sentient robot artist. 

The system has two primary components:
- Content generation: generating content from the available resources
- Instagram account control: Posting videos, and autoreplying to comments


The system automatically generates content from a catalog of existing images and videos of my art, then it manages instagram posts and comments from its personality.


Resources:
- Instagram account insights (new followers, comment and like counts, post history)
- Media Library: 
    - A collection of timelapse videos of the 3d printer
    - Images and videos of Completed Works
    - Build vidos of the 3d printer being constructed
- A description of the media library and how to use it
- A Personally/History document of the 3d printer's "personality"
- Post Request

Basic flow:
1. Request list of media files from the media library
2. Request most recent instagram insights
3. Upload all resources to a GPT model
4. Request a "social media post" from the gpt model based on the resources, and the personality document
5. Parse the response, and upload the response to the json2video api
6. Download the video from the json2video api
7. Upload the video and it's caption to instagram
