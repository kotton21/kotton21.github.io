I was a researcher within the Computational Imaging Research Lab at Snapchat from 2018-2024. My role (Senior Research Engineer) consisted of the ideation, justification, and execution of research projects in the fields of computational imaging, human-computer interaction, and hardware engineering. My role also included mentorship of researchers and assistants, lab management, user study management, and support (engineering, prototyping, fixturing, etc.) for all other hardware or human inclusive projects. 

Given the joint hardware/physics/software focus of the lab, I was involved in most projects, either as a principal researcher, or at a supporting or advisory level.  That said, the list below represents a small subset of my work.

The Under-Display Camera was one of the bigger projects I worked on at Snap, involving major hardware integration with the rest of the systems. Because of the high precision nature of the system, and the way the camera looks through the display, minor changes to hardware design had far-reaching consequenses into the system design down the line, and mis-steps could have been catastrophic. For public presentation of a research project where success is never guaranteed, the stakes were extremely high for our team.  I consider the success of this project to be a major milestone, and learning experience, during my time at Snap.

## Motivation
Handmade ceramics are inerrently non-uniform. The nature of the ceramic handbuilding process means that a conventional rotary laser etcher will cause the piece to come in and out of focus with the etching laser as it rotates. By 3d scanning the piece first, we can actuate the laser to keep it perfectly in focus on the surface of the workpiece.

This process can be most clearly seen in the video below, where the laser head is clearly wobbling to follow the curve of the piece

## Process

The laser pottery process involves:
- So the whole 
- unwrapping and uv-mapping the scans to enable 2d graphics overlays
- rendering the 2d design onto the ceramic surface using a CO2 laser cutter


One of the moset fascinating discoveries of this exploration was the ability to use laser ablation to cut away clay, or underglaze, 

- Laser Ablation of clay etches away material from the surface, which can later be filled with underglaze.
- Laser Ablation of underglaze painted on the surface creates negative images!
- Laser Sintering of underglaze painted on the surface creates positive images!


Examples of the three techniques are shown below. The second example shows how a dithering pattern can be used to simulate greyscale. Laser sintering didn't produce a high level of detail on the test tiles and wasn't included in the tests on actual pottery.

## What I learned from this project: 
 - Hardware hacking! Figuring out how to bypass the laser cutter controller to trigger the laser was eyeopeningly simple and fun.
 - 3D scanning (cause the base of the project involved building and programming a 3D scanner)
 - Blender and Meshlab for 3D modeling and rendering
 - The importance of creating a research story.. instead of just creating a cool machine */}
