A moody little pandemic project

Drilling 1024 holes in the back of an acrylic mirror was.. mind numbing.

I was playing with this design during covid lockdown for a fun bedroom mood lighting/mirror as a way to keep myself busy. 

The main idea was to sort of infinity-mirror a full 32x32 LED panel and see how it reacts. The effect was pretty striking.
